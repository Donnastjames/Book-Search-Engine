## Description

This is a book search engine that uses Google Books API, which has been refactored to use GraphQL API, and built with an Apollo Server.  React is used on the front end and it utilizes MongoDB.

## Installation
Initialize a React application by typing `create-react-app` in the command line.

`Apollo`, `GraphQL`, `jwt-decode`, `Bootstrap`, `bcrypt`, `Express`, `if-env` and `Mongoose` were installed through `npm install`.

## Usage
After the page loads, users can search for books by typing a title into the `Search for a book` field and clicking on the `Submit Search` button.  In order to save a book, users must either sign up or login.  Once users are logged in, they are able to save a book, and view all of their saved books by clicking on the `See Your Books` link.
